``` javascript
const what = "is javascript?";
```

To begin with, `JavaScript` is **not**, `Java`.

`JavaScript` was invented by a programmer whos name is **Brendan Eich**, in 1995. Because of the _dot-com boom_ in the 90's and Java being the popular new language at the time. Brendan Eich named it, JavaScript, as a marketing ploy to ride Java's success wave.

`JavaScript` alongside `HTML` & `CSS` is the core technology of the _World Wide Web_. And is a language every **web developer** should know.
