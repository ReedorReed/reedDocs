## What is CSS?

**CSS** is a language used to style a web page. **CSS** stands for **_Cascading Style Sheets_**. **CSS** tells HTML how it should be displayed on the screen. With a **CSS** file `.css` we can style more pages at once, as long as we link to it in the HTML `<head>`. It is also possible to style HTML inline by using the `<style>`tag. But this is **not** best practice.
